# Installation

*Caution:* This project fiddles with your network interfaces. Please consider to use it in a virtual machine for testing purposes.

There is an installation script provided, that will create a folder called `workspace` in the current working directory.
**There is no need to clone the repo before installing.**
The script will ask you for your password because it needs sudo permissions.
To install all the dependencies (tested on Debian Buster), run:

```
./install.sh
